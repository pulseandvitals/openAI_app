Primarily rural, Montana is home to national parks, miles of open country, an abundance of wildlife and spectacular scenery.\nHowever, there are also a number of vibrant cities with a flair for cowboy culture. As you plan your upcoming getaway to this state, don't miss out on any of these unforgettable places to visit in Montana.\n10. Great Falls\nIn the very center of Montana is Great Falls, a destination that is also known as the Electric City. Great Falls is often considered a stopping point when diving across Montana or when exploring nearby national parks, but the city also offers a lot in its own right. You could, for example, spend a day visiting the Ryan Dam, which boasts miles of surrounding hiking trails and is where the Electric City got its nickname.\nYou might also want to walk along the banks of the Missouri River, feed the trout and get to know more about American history at the Giant Springs State Park and the nearby Lewis and Clark National Interpretive Center.\n9. Missoula\nThe second largest of Montana's cities is Missoula, the home to the sprawling campus of the University of Montana. Missoula used to be a hub for rail travel, and you can still see the historic and preserved railroad stations around town. History lovers might also want to check out the iconic Caras Park Carousel, the Missoula Art Museum and the iconic Roxy Theater.\nThe Clark Fork River flows through the center of Missoula and is a hub for recreation, so you could also try rafting down the river or strolling along the waterfront Kim Williams Trail. Head Downtown for a number of local breweries, excellent independent restaurants and boutique shops perfect for snagging unique souvenirs.\n8. Lewis and Clark Caverns State Park\nThe oldest and perhaps most impressive state park in Montana is the Lewis and Clark Caverns State Park, located just outside of Three Forks. The caverns are made from limestone, and they boast interesting columns, stalactites and stalagmites.\nGuided tours of the caverns themselves cover a substantial amount of ground, and they take you down 600 steps until the air becomes noticeably cooler. Aside from the caverns themselves, which are open throughout the summer, the state park offers the opportunity to hike, enjoy a scenic picnic, go canoeing or spot wildlife in their natural habitats.\n7. Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument\nArguably one of the most famous military battles in American history took place at the Little Bighorn Battlefield. This is where Custer's Last Stand took place in 1876 between the United States and Native American tribes like the Dakota, the Lakota, the Northern Cheyenne and the Arapaho.\nTo this day, a big draw to the area is the reenactments that typically happen on an annual basis. You can tour the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, and you can also head into the nearest town, Crow Agency, for dining, shopping and water sports.\n6. Helena\nMany people begin their Montana adventures in the city of Helena, which is the state's capital as well as a hub in the heart of Gold West Country. The main attraction in the city is the Montana State Capitol Building, which is available for guided tours throughout the week.\nmain attraction\nYou'll also want to check out the Gates of the Mountains of the Missouri River, a collection of cliffs that open up to the river and were famously named by the explorers Lewis and Clark. Helena is also home to the historic mining district known as Reeder's Alley, the beautifully hand-carved Great Northern Carousel and the 19th century Old Fire Tower.\n5. Whitefish\nJust north of Kalispell, a city known for being the gateway to the Glacier National Park, is the charming resort destination of Whitefish. Located in Flathead Valley, Whitefish was created by glacier activity, and there is an abundance of freshwater in the surrounding area, dotting the landscape with pristine lakes and stunning streams.\nMost of the attractions in Whitefish are natural, and opportunities for outdoor activity abound. You may want to fish from Whitefish Lake, ski at the Whitefish Mountain Resort, kayak along the Flathead River or tee off at one of the great local golf courses in the area.\n4. Flathead Lake\nJust 15 minutes south of the city Kalispell is Flathead Lake, which is officially the largest natural freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. Formed by glaciers, Flathead Lake is a connection to the past for Montana, but it also serves as a hub for sightseeing and recreation in the 21st century. Just north of the lake, you can try hiking or even horseback riding.\nDuring the summer, fresh cherries are readily available at farmer's markets around Flathead Lake. Sailing is also growing in popularity, and rentals as well as lessons are available from several spots along the perimeter of Flathead Lake in Montana.\n3. West Yellowstone\nMuch of the famed Yellowstone National Park is located within the bordering state of Wyoming, but some of the entrances are actually located in Montana. One of the most commonly used is known as West Yellowstone. As the name suggests, this is the western entrance to the Yellowstone National Park.\nIn addition to serving as the entry point to one of the world's most incredible national parks, which is home to attractions like Old Faithful, West Yellowstone boasts the extensive collections of the Yellowstone Museum. You can also snag interesting souvenirs from the shops located along Yellowstone Ave or head to Faithful Street for some affordable local cuisine.\nattractions like Old Faithful\n2. Bozeman\nBozeman is one of the most popular cities in Montana for travelers, because it serves both as the home of Montana State University and as the gateway to the Yellowstone National Park.\nAlthough natural scenery is a big draw to Bozeman, there is also a large emphasis on culture, history and art. Start your visit to the city by checking out attractions such as the Pioneer Museum, the Museum of the Rockies, the Emerson Center for Arts and Culture and the unexpected but impressive American Computer Museum.\nchecking out attractions\nThe Gallatin River runs near Bozeman and provides opportunities for swimming, fishing and even kayaking, or you could get active by walking between the many bars and breweries Downtown in what is known as the Barmuda Triangle of Bozeman.\n1. Glacier National Park\nFor those in search of dramatic landscapes and breathtaking scenery, there are few destinations more appealing than Glacier National Park. On the border with Canada, and connected to the Canadian Waterton Lakes National Park, Glacier National Park is an incredible place to visit in Montana to see unparalleled flora and fauna.\nGlacier National Park\nShuttles and guided tours are readily available, but the best way to see the beauty of the park is on your own two feet.\nMore than 700 miles of hiking trails are available, with some of the most popular paths being the Trail of the Cedars and the Huckleberry Mountain Trail. Within the park, you can also go fishing, mountain biking or horseback riding, and there are opportunities for boating on Waterton Lake as well as Lake Mc Donald.\nMap of Montana\nShare this post:\nMontana Travel Guide\n12 Best Things to do in Montana\n25 Best Places to Visit in the USA\n12 Best Things to do in Helena, Montana\n12 Best Things to Do in Glacier National Park\n12 Best Things to do in Missoula, Montana\n25 Best National Parks in the USA\n12 Best Things to do in Bozeman, Montana\n12 Most Charming Small Towns in Montana\n6 Beautiful Rocky Mountain States\nReader Interactions",

This beautiful state has something to offer everyone, from stunning mountain ranges and pristine lakes to charming cities. In this article, I'll review the best places to visit in Montana.\nTable of Contents\n15 Best Places to Visit in Montana, USA\n1.

Flathead Lake\nIn Conclusion\nMontana is famous for being a part of the Wild Wild West, most visitors come to enjoy the great outdoors and get a feel for what the original pioneers must have felt.\nMontana's population is quite small with only 6 people per square mile. This means there aren't really any bustling cities; it's a great place to help you disconnect from your busy life, reconnect to nature, and recharge. The state is one of my favorite places in the US. Although, being from Montana, I may be biased.\nfavorite places in the US\nAs a native Montanan, my love for this state runs deep. I never truly understood why we considered ourselves the \"Big Sky\" state until I traveled to other parts of the United States. That's when I realized that inspiring star-filled nights and large blue bird skies were not the norm across the country.\nUnited States\nThe best time to visit Montana really depends on what you want to do, but whether you're looking to go skiing, or hiking in the mountains, you'll find it in this list of places to go in Montana.\nThe best time to visit Montana\nThere's a reason that Glacier National Park is one of the top places to see in Montana. The Rocky Mountains are truly majestic. There's something about the scale of them that's hard to wrap your head around until you see them in person. There are many national parks in Montana, with Glacier being my favorite.\nnational parks in Montana\nThe Rocky Mountains, (in Montana and Alberta, Canada), are my favorite for sure.\u00a0Glacier National Park is a top destination for solo travelers, couples, families, or groups of friends. It's one of the best places to visit in Montana for all types of travelers!\nRocky Mountains\ntop destination for solo travelers\nGlacier National Park offers over 700 miles of hiking trails, waterfalls, alpine meadows, and lakes.

While the majority of the park lies in Wyoming, there are three entrances to the park in Montana.\nCooke City. This entrance is only open in the summer when the Cooke City Highway and Pass are cleared of snow for the season. Drive up to 10,000 feet for breathtaking views of the Beartooth Mountains before reaching this small town and the entrance to Yellowstone. A bonus is that this entrance tends to be a little quieter than the others.\nGardiner. Getting to Gardiner requires driving through the iconic Paradise Valley, an area that many celebrities flock to for its beauty. Drive along the meandering river and enjoy the mountain views. For campers, there are a few state park campgrounds you can stay at before reaching the entrance.\nWest Yellowstone. This entrance is one of the most popular ones because of all that the town itself has to offer. With plenty of accommodation options, it's easy to explore Yellowstone.

Virginia City used to be a booming gold mining town with thousands of people. Now, you can explore the original buildings and get a feel for what life was like back then.\nNational Historic City\nWhat's most fun about Virginia City, (and what makes it one of the unique places to visit in Montana), is that it has the feel of a ghost town, but still has a population of around 600 people. These residents are proud of their small town and happily welcome you to explore.\nYou can wander around the city for free and pick up some goodies and souvenirs to take home. For a more immersive experience, book a tour on a vintage fire truck or the local train.\nYou can also check the local bars for shows or concerts whilst you're there.

Here are a few of my personal picks:\n. A very low-key developed hot pool approximately 40 minutes outside of Bozeman. This is my personal favorite developed hot spring.

This developed pool can be an all-inclusive visit as there's a hotel and restaurant on-site, or a stopover on your way to Yellowstone.\n. This developed pool is a bit off the beaten path and, quite honestly, in the \"middle of nowhere.\" Take a soak, then grab some goodies from the local Hutterites and explore the nearby Belt Mountain Range.\n.

The \"Treasure State\" is renowned for its numerous mineral and natural resources: copper, manganese, gold, sapphire, oil, zinc, and lead.\nBut while it may have lost a goodly chunk of its natural resources like oil, it still remains a goldmine for tourists looking for a mix of parks, wildlife, city attractions, and more!\n15 Best Places to Visit in Montana in 2023\nLet's be clear; outdoor places of interest dominate many other activities in this state, but there's still a wealth of things to do for all budgets and travel types. So, without further ado, let's dive into the best places to visit in Montana!\n1. Glacier National Park\nJay Yuan/Shutterstock\nMany tourists wish to visit the\u00a0Glacier National Park\u00a0at least once in a lifetime. Believe the hype because this park is incredible with abundant wildlife, crystal-clear waters, and the most picturesque stars you can ever see.\nGlacier National Park is unspoiled, unsullied nature at its most natural form. You can spend your entire vacation here without exploring half of what this incredible park offers.\nLake Mc Donald\u00a0is the largest park lake and perhaps the clearest.\u00a0The lake is roughly ten miles long, with a backdrop of the surrounding mountains that makes it perfect for a photoshoot.\nThe lake is unmissable, especially if you drive in through the entrance at the West Glacier.\u00a0Besides, you can find several designated picnic areas to stop by to enjoy the lake's beauty.\nHikers would love the formidable challenge of the Highline Trail, which starts at Logan Pass.\u00a0The last trail mile is quite steep, but the incredible views at the end are memories that will last you a lifetime.\nBest Time to Visit Glacier National Park\n2. Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area\nAlberto Loyo/Shutterstock\nBighorn Canyon\u00a0is one of the most convincing reasons to stop by the Treasure State, with its unrivaled natural splendor. It has a recreational area covering 120,000 acres with vast forests, deep gorges, wetlands, valleys, and the renowned Bighorn Lake.\nInterestingly, the\u00a0Yellowtail Dam established Bighorn Lake, which is one of the main attractions in the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area.\nThe 60-mile-wide lake touches the boundaries of Wyoming and Montana, providing exceptional fly fishing opportunities.\u00a0You will also enjoy boating, camping, and biking at the Bighorn, with 27 miles of scenic trails to hike.\nMost tourists to Bighorn Canyon prefer to fish and boat at the Bighorn River and Afterbay Lake, with excellent brown and rainbow trout fishing areas.\nBighorn Canyon makes this list because it's not overcrowded like Yellowstone National Park. It averages 250,000 tourists annually, ensuring some alone time for you on the trails.\n3. Virginia City\nMagmarcz/Shutterstock\nIt's common for people to mistake\u00a0Virginia City\u00a0for the State of Virginia. However, this historic Montana town used to be a gold haven in the 1800s, with approximately $90 million in gold extracted from the area worth $2.06 billion today.\nThe city isn't the hustling, bustling mining town it was before. However, it's still home to over 100 historic structures decked with artifacts, exhibits, and furnishings from the 19th century.\u00a0The choices were to adapt or die, but Virginia City went a step further to flourish.\nVisitors to this town feel like they've been teleported into the days of the Old West, and the city lore and history make the area even more unique.\nThe city provides various ways to experience the heydays, with stagecoaches and narrow-gauge railroads a common sight. The Mark Twain Watering Hole was the favorite saloon for the great humorist who used to drink there.\nYou'll love stopping for a chat with the locals wearing period clothing, and they're sure to give you the best suggestions for a meal or drink. Try\u00a0Grandma's Fudge Factory\u00a0to taste the most delicious caramel apple in the entire West.\nGrandma's Fudge Factory\n4. Helena\nPaul Brady Photography/Shutterstock\nMontana's capital balances the historical past with an exciting present. It's safe to say\u00a0Helena\u00a0offers a balanced representation of the state's offerings through its places of interest.\nYour first port of call is the Montana State Capitol, bedecked with comely hillsides in a serene neighborhood. The Capitol Building evokes a stately aura thanks to its neoclassical architecture. Still, true craftsmanship and beauty are hidden within the building.\nYou can tour the interior within regular operating hours. Places worth checking out include the Capitol Rotunda, Old Law Library, and the various works of art that you can find in the entire structure.\nIn addition, you can visit the more posh neighborhoods of\u00a0Last Chance Gulch, where the city was established.\nProspectors of the distant past struck gold in this area and thus began the early beginnings of this timeless city.\u00a0Adolescents and little kids will enjoy the Big Dipper Ice Cream.\nBig Dipper Ice Cream\nAt the same time, the Gulch offers excellent dining areas and patio seating for culinary connoisseurs. The town also has a thriving nightlife scene that bursts into life when the sun falls.\n5. Livingston\nNick Fox/Shutterstock\nLivingston is a few minutes away from Bozeman. It oozes a rustic charm most people overlook for its wealthier neighbors. However, there are many great activities in store, including museums, outdoor activities, and a budding art scene!\nYou can head out with the family on a trip down the\u00a0Yellowstone River. The water is warm in the summertime, and you can swim alongside the boat.\nIf you arrive in fall, you can do the same thing, only this time you get to watch the snowfall! The scenic views down the river are a soothing balm for the soul no matter what time of the year you show up.\nBesides swimming, the river is an excellent location for fly fishing. Remember to get your fishing license, and only two people can fish from the boat at one time.\nBesides water-based activities, the Yellowstone Gateway Museum offers a fascinating way to live through Yellowstone's history with many authentic artifacts and memorabilia.\nYellowstone Gateway Museum\n6. Missoula\nKeegan Connell/Shutterstock\nMissoula is arguably one of the best places to visit in Montana and the state's second-largest. The city is breathtakingly beautiful, but you can also lose your breath due to its high elevation at 978 meters above sea level.\nThe Garden City is rightly so-called because of the spectacular wilderness areas that offer fantastic hiking, biking, and camping opportunities. Also, three rivers meet here, making this confluence city the best place for kayaking, boating, and swimming.\nThe\u00a0Missoula Butterfly House and Insectarium will give you a fascinating insight into the world of butterflies and other insects.\nMissoula Butterfly House and Insectarium\nBeer lovers will enjoy chugging a jug at the Bugs and Brews Program, where you learn about the various insects while sipping a cold brew.\u00a0Missoula has one of the most delicious eats in Montana, and you can stop by Caras Park to enjoy cuisines from different parts of the globe.\n7. Whitefish\nBeeldtype/Shutterstock\nWhitefish is a charming small town in Flathead County and is popular because it's near Glacier National Park. You can spend a few days at the\u00a0Whitefish Mountain Resort\u00a0with lots of mountain biking and hiking in summertime or skiing and snowboarding in winter.\nThe resort spans 3000 acres, with many hiking trails to explore. The excellent idea is to go with the family on a daycation to the Glacial National Park.\nThis option allows you to enjoy the best Whitefish offers while crossing the world-famous park off your list.\u00a0Whitefish City Beach provides non-motorized boating opportunities, especially during the warm seasons.\nAnglers can stake out the water for lake trout, and if that's not your scene, you can head to the Whitefish Lake State Park for some camping and hunting.\u00a0Veteran golfers and newbies will enjoy practicing their swings at the\u00a0Whitefish Lake Golf Club, a stone's throw away from downtown.\n8. Yellowstone National Park\nCheryl Ramalho/Shutterstock\nThere could never be a list of the best places to visit in Montana without including\u00a0Yellowstone National Park. The sheer size of this national park makes it larger than Delaware and the State of Rhode Island combined.\nIt's roughly 2.2 million acres and accessible through Idaho and Montana, with a large proportion of its territory in Wyoming. You have two choices to enter the park from Montana.\nYour first option is the North Entrance which is another adventure on its own with many gateway communities to explore. On the other hand, you can drive through the West Entrance, which takes you through geyser country.\nSome of the iconic geysers worth visiting include the Steamboat Geyser and Norris Geyser Basin. There are other more popular geysers to explore, including the world-famous\u00a0Old Faithful situated to the South.\nThe park has the largest concentration of hot springs on earth and is home to large buffalo herds, wolves, and grizzly bears.\nBest Time to Visit Yellowstone National Park\n9. Chinese Wall\nMichelle Holihan/Shutterstock\nDo you know there's a Great Wall of China in the United States? And it's in our very own Montana! This\u00a0Chinese Wall\u00a0in the\u00a0Bob Marshall Wilderness Area is as impressive as the original and accessible through the\u00a0Benchmark Trailhead.\nThe Chinese Wall isn't an artificial structure but a colossal limestone barrier over 1000 feet and stretching for miles. Unfortunately, not everyone can get to see this Wall because of the highly challenging hike.\nIt's a backpacking adventure consisting of a 40-mile trail for the experienced hiker. The course starts from West Augusta.\nYou'd have to camp at several different sites before getting to your destination.\u00a0An excellent option is to go on a guided tour with experienced professionals to make your backpacking journey more pleasurable.\n10. Makoshika State Park\nLaurens Hoddengbagh/Shutterstock\nMakoshika State Park is so aptly named because of the barren landscape that spans Eastern Montana. Tourists who stop by this park are often stunned by its surreal beauty.\nMillions of years of wind erosion carved up the badlands as it is today, and the park has two sections.\u00a0The Lower Section is easier to hike, allowing you to explore the sparse flora and fauna in Cains Coulee.\nYou can also find the primary campground in this area, including designated picnic spots and the Gabriel Trailhead.\nThe level road goes on for five miles before inclining upwards until you get to a level that takes you to the Upper Section. The vistas in this section are a magnificent sight to behold, and it's advisable to explore this terrain using the maintained roads.\nThe Upper Section will take you through the Artist's Vista Campground. You'll find the Makoshika Amphitheatre in this section.\nOther areas of interest include The Pine On The Rocks Campground and the Cap Rock Trailhead.\u00a0Makoshika State Park has many dinosaur fossils, including Edmontosaurus, Triceratops, and the Tyrannosaurus Rex, all discovered in the area.\nBest National Parks in the United States in 2023\n11. Big Sky Resort\nZorro Stock Images/Shutterstock\nIf you're visiting Montana in winter, then you've got to pack your gear for some of the best skiing of your life at the\u00a0Big Sky Resort. The resort averages 400 inches of snow annually and attracts skiers from the US.\nBig Sky Resort has close to 6,000 skiable acres, and some of the activities worth trying out include:\nNordic Skiing\nNature Zipline\nAdventure Zipline\nEnchanted Forest\nSnowshoe Tours\nWinter is a fantastic time to visit, but summer also provides various fun activities. Golf and mountain biking are notable events in the warm seasons.\u00a0You can also enjoy Scenic Lift Rides with family and friends.\nLace up your hiking shoes to go on a voyage of discovery with experienced basecamp guides who'll teach you basic survival skills for thriving in the wild.\n12. Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center\nKim Lewis Photography/Shutterstock\nThe\u00a0Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center\u00a0is in West Yellowstone \u2013 a short distance from the park's Western Entrance. It was founded as an animal sanctuary and features gray wolves and grizzlies in their natural habitat.\nThe non-profit center provides a unique opportunity to learn about these animals, including their feeding habits, social behaviors, and history. You can visit all year round.\nOther animals in this controlled environment include frogs, river otters, snakes, and fishes native to the area. Kids receive a better understanding of the Yellowstone wildlife through the numerous educational programs.\n13. World Museum of Mining\nRadoslaw Lecyk/Shutterstock\nThe\u00a0World Museum of Mining\u00a0is one of the few worldwide that's located in a real mine \u2013 the\u00a0Orphan Girl Mine. Interested visitors will find this museum in Butte, Montana, on the city's outskirts.\nWorld Museum of Mining\nDespite its location away from downtown, the mine plays a significant role for the locals. First established in 1875, The Orphan Girl was known for its silver production, staying in operation for 75 years.\nToday, the museum provides essential knowledge about the daily life of miners in Butte. Most of the equipment is in excellent condition. Visitors can ride the cages miners use as they descend into the mine's dark depths.\nYou should set aside time for this trip because the museum houses 15 historic buildings, including many exhibits and artifacts from the early 20th century. Other areas of interest when visiting Butte include:\nThe Dumas Brothel\nBerkeley Pit\nMai Wah Museum\nOrphan Girl Bourbon Cream Liqueur\nThe museum hosts an underground tour up to 100 feet. You can check out the Miners Memorial Wall erected in honor of the men who lost their lives working underground this Butte mine.\n14. The Museum of the Rockies\nHugh K Telleria/Shutterstock\nIf there ever was a doubt\u00a0Bozeman\u00a0is one of the best places to visit in Montana,\u00a0The Museum of the Rockies\u00a0makes it a no contest. This museum isn't all about dinosaurs \u2013 it also features a planetarium on the premises.\nHowever, you'd need to buy another ticket to spend time at the Taylor Planetarium, which showcases the solar system and other films on an immersive screen.\nYou'll receive a museum map with your ticket, which makes the entire museum easy to get around. The MOR is known for its dinosaur fossil collections, and you can check it out at the Siebel Dinosaur Complex.\nOther exciting areas of interest in this complex include:\nThe Mesozoic Media Center\nThe Hall of Growth and Behavior\nHall of Horns and Teeth\nHall of Giants\nThe MOR also has a gift shop which is the best place to purchase a dinosaur gift for family and friends.\n15. Flathead Lake\nKen Lund/Flickr\nFlathead Lake\u00a0is the largest freshwater body in the West and is 28 miles long. At 185 miles, the shoreline is farther than the eye can see.\u00a0Even though the lake is famous in the region, it's still a mystery for many unwary visitors to Montana.\nFlathead lake is the ultimate playground for water-based activities. You can do anything from kayaking to motorboating, sailing, swimming, and fly fishing.\nIn addition to watersports, there are numerous recreation activities like camping, hiking, and hunting.

Once you make the trek here, you'll understand why. Untamed rivers run for hundreds of miles, teeming with trophy trout, cutting through the corrugated peaks that loom large along the horizon. Through the thicketed forests, world-class hikes lead to hot springs, geysers, and glaciers in every direction. The powder-packed skiing of winter is rivaled in magnitude by the whitewater rafting of summer. Everything is, well, bigger. To enjoy it all, you need nothing more than a rugged sense of an adventure \u2014 and a sensible travel plan. The former is up to you, but we can certainly supply the latter. Your ultimate guide to Montana exploration is below.\n\nBest Time to Visit Montana\nThe short answer is whenever you want. When you should arrive in Montana is entirely dependent on what you want to do. If you're more inspired by winter sports, world-class ski resorts such as Big Sky and Moonlight Basin are smothered in snow from early December through mid-April. For those motivated by hiking, hot springs, and fly-fishing, June through September is a dependable time to pack your bags. However, if you want to avoid the crowds \u2014 especially in national parks like Glacier and Yellowstone \u2014 don't sleep on the shoulder season of late summer and early autumn.\nworld-class ski resorts\nBig Sky\nMoonlight Basin\nshoulder season\nBest Things to Do in Montana\nAlthough Montana is an unparalleled paradise for outdoor enthusiasts, it still has plenty to offer by way of cosmopolitan delights, especially within the hip college towns along the western part of the state. Over the past decade, Bozeman has come into its own as one of the coolest mountain towns in the U.S. You can enjoy craft cocktails in dimly lit speakeasies like the Devil's Toboggan, or chow down on stuffed quail and other farm-fresh delicacies at Blackbird. Or, spend time in Missoula and soak up the sensational local beer scene at Conflux Brewing Company or Cranky Sam Public House. Either way, if you're looking to enjoy the nightlife \u2014 or a pub crawl \u2014 during your time in Montana, make sure you're booking a stay in one of these two destinations.\ncoolest mountain towns in the U.S.\nDevil's Toboggan\nIf you're more interested in camping out under the stars, Montana is in no short supply of options. Big Sky Country, it turns out, affords plenty of dark sky, completely devoid of nocturnal light pollution. A great way to experience it all is through the expansive state park system. Flathead Lake is an underrated gem here. It's the largest natural freshwater lake west of the Mississippi and a wonderful summer getaway for boating, swimming, and fishing, offering a multitude of pull-up campsite options.\ndark sky\nWhile up this way, in the northeastern reaches of the state, you'll want to devote some time to strolling the quaint resort towns of Kalispell and Whitefish. And if it's between late June and early October, you'll definitely want to plod through Glacier National Park along the aptly named Going-the-the-Sun Road. Just beware that traffic along the route can be intense throughout this time of year.\nGlacier National Park\nFurther south in Bozeman, the surrounding Gallatin Valley acts as the entry way to Yellowstone. Although the nation's first national park is primarily located in Wyoming, many of its five million annual visitors come by way of this part of Montana. Come in the summer and you can book world-class whitewater rafting adventures through the three river systems that ultimately converge to form the Missouri River.\nworld-class whitewater rafting adventures\nFancy an unforgettably epic road trip? Traverse the 69 miles of Beartooth Highway between Red Lodge and Cooke City. Crescendoing atop a wide plateau 11,000 feet above sea level, this legendary section of U.S. Route 212 is among the most picturesque stretches of highway in the country. But if soaring, vertigo-inducing heights aren't your thing, head an hour west of Bozeman and delve downward into the Lewis and Clark Caverns \u2014 one of the biggest limestone caves in the country.\nArrive in winter and you can survey the snow-capped terrain aboard a Ski-Doo. West Yellowstone serves as the snowmobile capital of the lower 48 from December through March. If you prefer to plow through the powder with actual horsepower, check out Big Sky, where you can charter sleigh rides that are sure to enchant the entire family. At the end of an action-packed day, relax your weary bones and soak up the scenery from the region's heralded hot springs.\nsurvey the snow-capped terrain aboard a Ski-Doo\nhot springs\nWhere to Stay in Montana\nWhen it comes to overnight options, they are as varied as they are abundant, from primitive pull-up campsites and RV parks with mini golf to dude ranches and luxury boutiques with a bit of history.\npull-up campsites\nRV parks with mini golf\ndude ranches\nluxury boutiques with a bit of history\nIf you're craving a high-end hideaway, the town of Big Sky has emerged as the go-to destination. Home to its eponymous ski resort for nearly 50 years, only in recent years has the luxury set spread its wings here. Lone Mountain Ranch is a stellar standout, and high in the running for best resort in all of Montana. The property features stand-alone log cabins along gently moving creeks. You can do guided yoga in the morning and horseback riding in the afternoon. At the base of the slopes, the Montage just opened the doors to its 139-room ski-in, ski-out resort.\neponymous ski resort\nLone Mountain Ranch\nthe Montage\nFor rustic charm further north in the state, book a stay at The Lodge at Whitefish Lake, nestled between its namesake lake and the 28-acre Viking Creek Wetland Preserve. Its thoughtful amenities \u2014 hot tubs, spa, live music \u2014 are overshadowed only by its access to unspoiled wilderness.\nThe Lodge at Whitefish Lake\nBack in the cities of Bozeman and Missoula, boutique hotels are finally becoming part of the landscape. Notable among them is the new Kimpton Armory, a refurbished property from the WWII barracks of the Montana National Guard. With 122 guest rooms, three restaurants, a rooftop pool featuring unimpeded views of the Bridger Mountains, and its own concert venue, it's quickly becoming the place to be in downtown these days.\nBut if you're seeking a more laid-back bed-and-breakfast feel, Montana has you covered in every corner. For those looking for lodging in Missoula, a sensational example can be found at Blue Mountain \u2014 five private rooms set atop 20 acres of wildlife habitat directly next to Lolo National Forest. With Big Sky comes big options. Choose wisely.\nBlue Mountain",

It's situated right in between Montana's massive mountains to the west and the rolling farmland to the east.\nBut Billings often gets earmarked as just a starting off point or ending point if accessing Montana via the Billings International Airport.\nHowever, it would be a shame to overlook Billings on your trip since it has a burgeoning food and craft beer scene plus historic attractions. Despite being Montana's largest city, it has still retained a small town vibe, making it a welcoming place to explore while in Montana.\nTop attractions in Billings include the Billings Beer Trail, the Yellowstone Kelly Memorial atop the rims (rocky cliffs on the north end of Billings that gives the city a beautiful frame) and the Old Town Historic District where you'll find a number of old homes and museums.\nBillings Beer Trail\nAll the Top Things to Do in Billings, Montana\nBeautiful Bozeman is nestled in the gorgeous Gallatin Valley in southern Montana and is surrounded by mountains.

Another popular option is to stay in Bozeman, which is about an hour's drive away.\nSister time skiing with epic views at Red Lodge\nInsider's Guide for All the Best Places to Ski in Montana\nIf you want to ski where the locals ski (at least those who live in Billings and eastern Montana), head to Red Lodge instead of Big Sky in 2023.\nYou won't find any of the pomp and circumstance Big Sky is sometimes known for due to it glitzy clientele. Instead you'll find a laidback mountain town with one Main Street of restaurants and bars and a smattering of hotels.\nRed Lodge is also a popular destination in non ski seasons. Mostly because it's the start of the incredible Beartooth Highway Drive. This scenic drive leads to the northeast entrance of Yellowstone National Park.\nWinter Guide for Red Lodge Mountain\nBest Places in Montana for Viewing Animals\nIf you're an animal lover, here are the places to go in Montana for the best chances of seeing wildlife.\nWith drives, hiking trails, and wide, open plains that make it easy to see wildlife, Yellowstone National Park is one of the best places to visit in Montana for many reasons. However, for many visitors it's the wildlife that stands out.\nWhile driving through Yellowstone you're bound to see bison roaming the plains. Wolves, moose, bears, elk, mountain lions, and other animals are also possible to see.\nOne of the best places to see wildlife in the park is the Lamar Valley, which is located by Yellowstone's northeast entrance. The gateway to this entrance is Cooke City, MT. And an epic way to get to Cooke City is via that aforementioned Beartooth Highway. Mountain goats and birds of prey are often spotted along the windy Beartooth Highway.\nWhat You Need to Know Before You Visit Yellowstone\nExperience the land and its animals the Montana way \u2014 or at least the Montana cowboy way \u2014 with a stay at a dude ranch.\nYou can choose to stay at a small family-run ranch where you'll get to know the family well. Participate in day to day tasks that will truly give you a taste of what it's like to live on a working ranch.\nWant some pampering? Choose one of the luxury dude ranches. You'll dine on exquisite food, can get spa treatments after horseback rides, and do one-of-a-kind guided adventures.\nSt. Ignatius Mission\nThe Best Dude Ranches in Montana\nBest Places to Visit in Montana for History\nThere is so much history to found in Montana, but here are a couple places that stand out for 2023.\nA historic place to visit between Missoula and Flathead Lake is the town of St. Ignatius on the Flathead Indian Reservation.\nSt. Ignatius is home to the similarly named St. Ignatius Mission, which is a popular tourist attraction in this area.\nSt. Ignatius Mission is a Catholic Church that dates back to the 1890s. When visited, it must be seen from the inside. That's where you'll see the 58 original paintings on the ceiling painted by Brother Joseph Carignano. There is also a museum next to the mission.\nTo learn more about the history of the area, head to\u00a0the Ninepipes Museum of Early Montana in St. Ignatius where you can learn more about the importance the land has played to the native people of Montana throughout the past centuries.\nSt. Ignatius is also near the Mission Mountains, which provides visitors with opportunity to partake in a number of outdoor activities. Popular ones include rock climbing, ice climbing, river rafting, and boating.\nLocated in Central Montana, Butte is located between Missoula and Bozeman right off I-94. As a result, most road trippers drive right through this historic city or just stop to get gas.\nThis is definitely doing yourself a disservice!\nButte has an incredible history and was once nicknamed the \"Richest Hill on Earth.\" This moniker was due to the extensive minerals (and resulting riches) its massive mining industry unearthed in the early 1900s.\nToday, the mining industry is gone, but you can still see remnants of it, both in downtown Butte and on the outskirts of town.\nIn downtown Butte, tour the gorgeous Victorian homes from the mining town's heyday. Beyond the town, you can see the Anaconda Smelter Stack jutting up into the sky. Drive up the hill to view acidic Berkely Pit, a sad reminder of the toll mining has on the earth.\nThe Best Things to Do in Butte\nNo matter what type of vacation you're looking for, these best places in Montana to visit are epic. Each place will have you experiencing Montana in an epic way with gorgeous scenery.",

You'll find many tourist attractions, cultures, and communities in these places \u2013 perfect for getting a\u00a0real\u00a0feel of Montana living. These are our top eleven best towns and cities in Montana.\n1. Helena\nHelena is Montana's capital city. If you want action, culture, and a lively but friendly atmosphere, Helena is where to visit in Montana. The city is packed with art galleries, museums, and historical architecture. You'll spend a lot of time on your feet, be it walking Reeder's Alley or through the exhibits at the Montana Historical Society.\nHelena was originally a gold camp in the Montana gold rush. Its glitzy history is recognizable thanks to the city's wealth today, and visitors can enjoy wandering the elegant historical buildings \u2013 especially in the downtown district.\nOf course, you can't visit a state capital without visiting the State Capitol Building either. Montana State Capitol is well worth visiting for its architectural and political history.\n2. Big Sky\nHave you heard of Big Sky Country? If not, Big Sky is a small ski town in the Rocky Mountain region of Southwest Montana. The town is most famous for Big Sky Resort and is one of the best places to visit in Montana for a winter getaway.\nAccording to Forbes, the town is surrounded by \u20185,850 skiable acres.

It makes things much more convenient.\ngrab your ski rentals here\n3. Philipsburg\nPhilipsburg is small but mighty. First and foremost, it is a mining town. Philipsburg has kept an industrial, old west atmosphere that makes it a fantastic place to visit. The tiny town is no shy wallflower on Montana's tourist scene either and has scored the title of the most beautiful small town in Montana. If you like immersive history and small towns, look no further.\nGranite County Museum is a great place to discover Philipsburg's old mining industry, while Granite Ghost Town State Park is another gem to visit. The abandoned town is the remnants of the region's golden years during the mining boom of the late 19th century. Immerse yourself in Philipsburg and its surrounding area's distinct characters.\n4. Garryowen\nGarryowen gets its name from an old Irish marching song. The town itself has strong military links, and it was formed as a cavalry station. One of the town's best attractions, Custer National Cemetery, is a military graveyard marked by the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument. Visitors can walk to mass burial sites marked by white memorials and visit the visitor center and museum on-site.\n\nNowadays, Garryowen is located on Crow Indian Reservation. If you are interested in 19th-century American history or military history in general, Garryowen is a great place to visit. You can learn about the town's history, pay respects to local Native American culture, or visit the Little Bighorn National Monument.\n5. Great Falls\nGreat Falls is a stunning riverside city located in central Montana. Great Falls is known as somewhat of a cultural hub, and you'll find museum after museum in the city. You can spend your days visiting the C.M. Russell Museum, Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art, or the Children's Museum of Montana. There's even the Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center, which follows the story of the Lewis & Clark western expedition with unique exhibits, films, and displays.\nGreat Falls is an excellent choice if you want an interesting cultural base in central Montana. It has a lively city atmosphere and is only a two-hour drive from Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest and Giant Springs State Park \u2013 home to one of the largest natural hot springs in the US.\n6. Bozeman\nWant a pleasant stay in Montana? Bozeman is considered the most liveable place in the state, making it one of the best places to visit in Montana for a laidback getaway.\nIn the city center, there are more attractions than you can count. Bozeman itself is located just outside of the mountainous region around Big Sky, with plenty of small towns and areas of natural beauty to explore on a day trip. If you don't mind a two-hour drive, there's Yellowstone to your south and Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest to your north.\nYellowstone to your south\nBozeman is also home to Montana State University, giving the city a sociable, friendly atmosphere. You can head to the trendiest eateries, soak in Bozeman Hot Springs, or make the most of the city's fantastic location for day trips in nature. Bozeman is the perfect compromise between city living and access to natural wonders.\n7. Whitefish\nLike Big Sky, Whitefish is a little resort town that floods with skiers every winter. The town is one of the best places to visit for outdoor fun and adrenaline sports. Whitefish is scenically situated on the outskirts of Glacier National Park and has stunning alpine views \u2013 perfect for beautiful scenery while cross-country skiing. There's also a vast freshwater lake, where you can enjoy a dip or spend some time fly fishing in summer.\nWhitefish's famous ski resort is Whitefish Mountain Resort.

This private full-day tour has something for everyone!\nprivate full-day tour\n8. Missoula\n9. Choteau\nChoteau might seem off the beaten track and unassuming. However, the town is one of the best paleontology sites in the world. Exciting, right? If you love everything fossils and geology, then a visit to Choteau should be on the cards. In fact, its nearby Egg Mountain was used as a breeding ground for dinosaurs millions of years ago. In nearby Bynum, you can participate in fossil digs at the Montana Dinosaur Center.\nOld Trail Museum is the major attraction in Choteau itself. The museum covers everything from dinosaurs to teepees. Old Trail Museum is a perfect stop-off and place to spend an hour or two, especially if you like your museums eclectic.\nMissoula has become known as a natural retreat, despite its city status. The city is divided into two by the Clark Fork River, famed for its Blue Trout (take note if you love fishing). Situated in Western Montana, Missoula is right next to the Idaho border and is within driving distance from Lolo and Flathead National Forests. Missoula is a beautiful place to visit if you want to base yourself in Western Montana.\nOf course, the city also has a lot of its own attractions, including the Missoula Art Museum. While history lovers can learn more at Missoula Natural History Museum and the Historical Museum at Fort Missoula.\n10. Butte\nButte was once a gold and silver mining camp. A couple of centuries later, Butte is now one of the best places to visit in Montana and one of the state's most booming cities. Butte is somewhere to appreciate Montana's past while enjoying the present moment. The city has great historical attractions and a fantastic entertainment scene.\nYou can discover the city's humble beginnings at the World Museum of Mining. You can also peer into Berkeley Pit (an old copper mine) from a viewing stand within easy walking distance from the city center. Alternatively, have a flutter by visiting Richest Hill. Richest Hill is Butte's casino and the center of its nightlife and partying scene \u2013 great if you want to let your hair down.\n11. Virginia City\nVirginia City is one of our absolute favorite places in Montana. The town is a complete time capsule, from log cabins to old western street signs. Get ready to be transported back to 19th-century Montana.\nThe town has a small museum called the Thomas-Hickman Museum. You can also catch a performance at the Virginia City Opera House. However, the main draw of Virginia City is to just walk the traditional town main street and soak up the old western architecture and atmosphere. Virginia City is easily the most authentic place to visit in Montana. You'll love it, especially if you love immersive history.\nBest natural places to visit in Montana\nNow that we've covered the best towns and cities, let's look at the best natural places to visit in Montana. From national parks to state parks, these are our top ten recommendations.\n12. Yellowstone National Park\nYellowstone is a celebrity amongst US national parks. You'll find the world's largest collection of geysers, including Old Faithful. There are also more hot springs, mountains, and animals than you'll be able to count. If you want a national park that will provide lifelong memories, Yellowstone National Park is the one.\nYellowstone actually straddles Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. While the largest section of the park is in Wyoming, you can experience some parts in Montana \u2013 or just allow time to cross the borders and see as much as possible. Some attractions, like the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center (near the West Yellowstone entrance) and the Museum of Yellowstone, are in Montana. Others, like Old Faithful, are located in Wyoming, so you'll need to allow extra travel time.\nIf you are interested in hiking don't miss our recommendations for the Best Hikes in Yellowstone, complete with difficulty ratings and elevation.\nBest Hikes in Yellowstone\nIn West Yellowstone, you'll find the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center. The animal refuge center has resident grizzly bears, grey wolves, and birds of prey. It is an excellent place to visit if you want to support a local not-for-profit and don't manage to spot animals in the wild.\nFancy an adrenaline rush? Go whitewater rafting down Yellowstone River. Yellowstone River snakes through the national park's center with many exciting sections of rapids \u2013 perfect for an adventurous day out.\nrafting down Yellowstone River.\n13. Flathead National Forest\nHow does 2.4 million acres of mountain forests sound? In winter, you can zip through Flathead National Forest on snowmobiles and skis. In spring and summer, you'll have hiking trails galore and no shortage of space for camping and multi-day treks. Flathead National Forest is an excellent natural place to visit in Montana, regardless of the season.\nThe forest is home to many animals, including black bears and grizzlies. You'll see bighorn sheep, elk, moose, and mules. And, if you keep your eyes on the skies, you may get lucky and catch sight of an eagle or owl. Flathead National Forest is one of the most rewarding natural places to visit in the state of Montana.\n14. Gates of the Mountains Wilderness\nJust outside of Helena, the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness is one of the most accessible places of natural beauty to visit in Montana. It is also one of the most exciting to explore since the best way involves hopping on a boat.\nThe nature preserve is situated along a section of the Missouri River that winds through a jaw-dropping mountain park. Sailing up the river, you can admire and be humbled by the scale of the mountain range surrounding you \u2013 definitely bring a camera.\nYou can take a guided tour or rent water sports equipment to appreciate the Gates independently. The Gates of the Mountains Wilderness is best visited in warm, dry weather, as sailing can get extremely cold with the strong breeze and exposure to the elements. We recommend visiting in late spring or summer for the best experience. Plus, the mountains will be covered in beautiful greenery during these months.\n15. Giant Springs State Park\nThe name Giant Springs State Park speaks for itself. The park is home to one of the US's largest freshwater springs, and the Giant Springs produces an incredible 156 million gallons of water daily. It is said that water takes approximately 26 years to reach the springs from its origin in the Little Belt mountains \u2013 a fascinating concept.\nAside from viewing this natural phenomenon though, visitors can make the most of river activities like fishing, swimming, and boating. There are also trails for mountain biking and horseback riding if you want to explore a little differently than on foot. The park was first discovered on the Lewis & Clark Expedition in 1805 and is an important location in the early mapping of Montana.\nGiant Springs is the best place for you if you like natural attractions with a large network of trails and a historical backstory.\n16. Lewis & Clark Caverns State Park\nLewis & Clark Caverns State Park is an excellent natural place to visit in Montana. The 3,000-acre park is best known for its limestone caverns, named the Clark Caverns. Visitors can take guided tours into the Clark Caverns for an ultimate caving experience. Allow just under two hours for a tour of the caverns, but a whole day to experience the best of the park.\nThe park is an exciting place to witness underground beauty and explore beautiful hikes in the sunshine above ground. It is undoubtedly one of the most unique places to visit in Montana if you want to experience natural beauty.\n17. Flathead Lake State Park\nFlathead Lake is split into six different park sections, so choose which area you want to visit wisely (our favorite is West Shore). The park is situated around Flathead Lake, making it ideal for fishing, swimming, and water sports activities. The park is the best place to spend a lake-side holiday and is dreamy in late spring and summer.\nFlathead Lake is a good option if you are looking for great camping spots in Montana. The park has many well-established campgrounds with plenty of facilities, which is excellent if you want a relaxing, entry-level camping experience.\n18. Spring Meadow Lake State Park\nSpring Meadow Lake State Park is a cheeky addition to our list of natural beauty spots. The 61-acre park has an artificial lake \u2013 so technically, it is a manmade area of beauty. However, it is so stunning we just had to add it to the list.\nThe park is best for those who want clear trails and purpose-made walking paths. You can follow the paths, stop for a bite to eat on one of the picnic benches, or enjoy some water activities. Spring Meadow Lake State Park is a popular spot for kayaking and paddle boarding, and you can hire equipment on-site if you don't have your own to bring along.\nThe best part about Spring Meadow Lake State Park is that it is located just outside of Helena. The park is less than a ten-minute drive from Helena's center and a great way to get some time in the outdoors during a city break.\n19. Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area\nHave you ever seen a wild horse? If not, Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area is where you just might. With a bit of luck, you'll spot herds of wild horses when exploring the area's hiking trails. There are also plenty of ranches where you can saddle up to see the wild horses on horseback.\nwild horses\nLocated on the Montana-Wyoming border, the area is centered around Bighorn Canyon itself, which is definitely worth visiting. You can drive to scenic overlooks or hike to the most remote yet rewarding viewpoints \u2013 it is totally up to you. Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area is full of surprises and exciting things to see.\n20. Makoshika State Park\nMeet the largest state park in Montana. Makoshika State Park is overflowing with fossils, and dinosaur lovers will be ecstatic at seeing the fossil remains of dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus Rex and Triceratops. Families note this park down for your little ones. But adults don't miss out on the fun either \u2013 Makoshika State Park impresses all ages.\nStart your visit at the visitor center, where you can admire a series of interpretive exhibits and the best dinosaur fossils. Then you can hike the Montana Dinosaur Trail for the ultimate paleontology experience. Allow a whole day to visit as there is so much to see, and you don't want to rush.\n21. Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument\nNow the Missouri River is the longest river in the US, so, unless you want to sail the length of it (which would be an exciting adventure), you'll have to choose a small section to visit. The river cuts through Montana east to west, passing multiple riverside towns and cities. However, our favorite place to enjoy the river is the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.\nUpper Missouri River Breaks National Monument is a 377,000-acre national park and the ideal spot for a riverside adventure. You can kayak, swim, or hike. To experience the Missouri River, the national park is the best and quietest place in Montana.\nOf course, you can also indulge in a river rafting experience to pump your adrenaline or sit along the river banks for some relaxing fly fishing. North Montana is also full of different attractions like Bear Gulch Pictographs and the Phillips County Museum that you can combine with visiting the park.\n22. Glacier National Park\nGlacier National Park is beautiful. There's no denying it. In particular, its hiking is renowned as some of the best in the US, and you can read our complete guide on the best hiking trails in Glacier National Park here. The park is sure to impress no matter the season and no matter your interests.\nIf you are in a rush, we recommend visiting Lake Mcdonald and Logan Pass. Lake Mcdonald is the park's largest lake and is a picture-perfect alpine destination with still water and mountainous views. Logan Pass is a dramatic elevation pass on the Continental Divide, with gorgeous scenery and lots of mountain goats to spot. You can't go wrong with a visit to Glacier National Park.\nFinal Thoughts\nMontana is incredible. The state has a dreamy mix of natural wonders and historic towns and cities to explore.
